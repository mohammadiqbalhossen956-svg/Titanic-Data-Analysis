Project Title: Titanic Data Visualization - Top 5 Ticket Fares

​Description-

​This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. By analyzing the famous Titanic dataset, I extracted the top 5 passengers who paid the highest ticket fares and visualized the data through a bar chart.

​Key Features-

​Data Retrieval: Fetched real-time data from a remote CSV source hosted on GitHub.

​Data Processing: Utilized Pandas to sort and filter the dataset to find the nlargest values based on the 'Fare' column.


​Data Visualization: Created a professional bar chart using Matplotlib to represent numerical data visually.

​Automated Export: The script automatically saves the generated chart as a .png file for reporting purposes.

​Technologies Used

​Language: Python

​Libraries: Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

​Environment: Developed and tested on Pydroid 3 (Mobile IDE)

​How to Run-

​Ensure you have pandas and matplotlib installed.
​Run the main.py script.
​The console will display the "Graph saved" message, and a bar chart titled top_5_fares.png will be generated in your directory.
